    "Aye, aye, men! cried Ahab.",
    "Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.",
    "Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.",
    "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance.",
    "To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.",
    "No fearless fool now fronts thee.",
    "I own thy speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.",
    "In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.",
    "Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights.",
    "But war is pain, and hate is woe.",
    "Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still remains indifferent.",
    "Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.",
    "[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST, CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.",
    "] I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.",
    "Thou canst blind; but I can then grope.",
    "Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.",
    "Take the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.",
    "I would not take it.",
    "The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground.",
    "Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.",
    "Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy.",
    "But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not.",
    "Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.",
    "Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.",
    "I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.",
    "There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.",
    "Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.",
    "Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.",
    "Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire.",
    "Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee! The boat! the boat! cried Starbuck, look at thy boat, old man! Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.",
    "As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.",
    "Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft.",
    "For the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised",
    "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",
    "There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
    "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",
    "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.",
    "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.",
    "First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.",
    "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",
    "'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.",
    ") Down, down, down.",
    "Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.",
    "'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.",
    "Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.",
    ") Presently she began again.",
    "'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is,",
    "Your house did, anyway, replied the little old woman, with a laugh, and that is the same thing.",
    "See! she continued, pointing to the corner of the house.",
    "There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.",
    "Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.",
    "There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.",
    "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay.",
    "The house must have fallen on her.",
    "Whatever shall we do?",
    "There is nothing to be done, said the little woman calmly.",
    "But who was she? asked Dorothy.",
    "She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said, answered the little woman.",
    "She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day.",
    "Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.",
    "Who are the Munchkins? inquired Dorothy.",
    "They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.",
    "Are you a Munchkin? asked Dorothy.",
    "No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.",
    "When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once.",
    "I am the Witch of the North.",
